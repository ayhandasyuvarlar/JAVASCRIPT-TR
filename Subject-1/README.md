# Javascript data types 

There are two different data types. Primitive data type and Referance data type. 


There are five different Primitive data example.This are number , string ,boolean , null and undefined . 

```js
var number = 1;
var str ="hello"
var boolean = true
var nullD = null
var undefined = ""
```

There are two different Referance data example.This are array and object .


### Array 
Arrays are actually a data structure and allow us to keep the same type of data on memory.

```js
var arraydata = ["harun" ,21 , true , 1.330 , [] , null]    
```

### Object 

In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost any area of the language. That's why we need to understand them before going deep into another place.

```js
var person = {
    name :"Fatih",
    age :"21"
}

var hello = function(){
    console.log("hello world")
}
console.log(hello)
```
